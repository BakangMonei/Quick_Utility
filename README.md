# QuickUtility App

## Description

**QuickUtility App** is a multi-functional utility Android application designed to provide users with tools for everyday tasks. This app includes various features such as a Calendar, Calculator, Unit Converter, and Flash Events. Additionally, it offers customizable settings (light/dark theme) and a help section to guide users through the app.

## Features

- **Calendar**: Add and view events for specific dates. Events can be created by tapping on a date, and they are displayed in a list for easy management. Events are erased when the app is closed.
- **Calculator**: A dual-mode calculator that supports both basic arithmetic operations and advanced scientific calculations (e.g., trigonometric functions, logarithms).
- **Converter**: Perform real-time conversions between common units such as length, weight, and temperature without saving any conversion history.
- **Flash Events**: Create quick events with titles and times, edit or delete events, and manage them in a list format. Events are erased after app closure.
- **Settings**: Customize the app's appearance by switching between light and dark themes.
- **Help**: A detailed help section that provides users with instructions on how to use each feature in the app.

## Technologies Used

- **Android SDK**: Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher.
- **Kotlin**: The main programming language used for development.
- **Android Jetpack Components**: Including `Fragment`, `RecyclerView`, `CalendarView`, and `BottomNavigationView`.
- **Material Design**: Used to create a sleek and modern UI using components like `FloatingActionButton` and `TabLayout`.
- **Monkey Tool**: Used for stress testing by generating random events in the app.
- **Lint Tool**: Used for code inspection to ensure the app adheres to Android development best practices.
